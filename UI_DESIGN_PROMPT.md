# UI Design Prompt for Gym App (300 words)

Design a gamified fitness tracking mobile app UI inspired by Clash Royale's vibrant, game-like aesthetic. Transform gym workouts into an engaging game experience with XP, levels, streaks, and achievements.

**Home Screen:** Large level badge showing level 1-100. XP progress bar next to it. Trophy card displaying monthly XP total. Start workout button.

**Workout Flow:** Session selection with template/custom option cards. Exercise selection with search bar, category filter chips, and selectable exercise cards. Workout screen: exercise cards with name, category, "Sets" subheading, weight/reps inputs per set, "+ Add Set" button, "Complete Workout" button.

**Screens:** Home (level badge, stats grid, trophy), Session Selection, Exercise Selection, Workout (sets input), Profile (bodyweight), Monthly XP History, Templates.

**Visual Style:** Game-like mobile game aesthetic. Vibrant colors, bold typography, card layouts, emoji icons, progress bars, achievement badges. Dark theme with colorful accents. Feel like Clash Royale, not a traditional fitness app.
